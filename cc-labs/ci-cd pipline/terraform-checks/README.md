erraform Validation Pipeline
This directory contains a CI pipeline that validates Terraform configuration using GitHub Actions.

The pipeline enforces consistent formatting and validates configuration correctness before any infrastructure changes are made. Terraform code is checked in CI, without applying resources or interacting with a live environment.

What this Pipeline Demonstrates
Enforcing Terraform formatting using terraform fmt -check
Validating Terraform configuration with terraform validate
Using CI to catch errors before infrastructure changes are applied
Keeping infrastructure provisioning out of CI by design
Pipeline Behaviour
Triggered on push
Runs Terraform from the terraform-validation directory
Initialises Terraform to load provider schemas
Checks formatting and validation
Does not apply or plan infrastructure
