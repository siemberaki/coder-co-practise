Docker Build and Push Pipeline
This directory contains a CI/CD pipeline that builds and publishes a Docker image to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.

The pipeline runs on push, builds the image from a scoped context, tags it, and pushes it to Docker Hub using credentials managed through GitHub Actions secrets.

The pipeline stops at the artefact stage by design. Image publishing is handled in CI, with deployment intentionally kept separate.

What this Pipeline Demonstrates
Building a Docker image in CI using an explicit build context
Publishing images to Docker Hub as part of an automated workflow
Secure authentication using GitHub Actions secrets
Keeping CI behaviour predictable and easy to reason about
Pipeline Behaviour
Triggered on push
Builds the image from the docker-build-push directory
Tags the image explicitly
Pushes the image to Docker Hub
Does not deploy or run containers
